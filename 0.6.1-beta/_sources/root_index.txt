Tethne: Corpus Analysis for Historians
======================================

Tethne is a Python package that draws together tools and techniques from bibliometrics, 
computational linguistics, and social influence modeling into a single easy-to-use corpus
analysis framework. Scholars can use Tethne to parse and organize data from the ISI Web of
Science, Scopus, and JSTOR Data-for-Research databases, and generate time-variant 
citation-based :mod:`.networks`\, :mod:`.corpus` models, and :mod:`.social` influence 
models. Tethne also provides :mod:`.writers` that make it easy to visualize those models
using mainstream network visualization software (eg `Cyotoscape <http://cytoscape.org>`_
and `Gephi <http://gephi.org>`_) and the `MatPlotLib Python library 
<http://matplotlib.org/>`_. Dataset :mod:`.persistence` for archiving and sharing data is
achieved using the `HDF5 file format <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_.
