Geographic Networks
===================

*This tutorial was developed for the course* `Introduction to Digital & Computational 
Methods in the Humanities (HPS) <http://devo-evo.lab.asu.edu/methods>`_, *created and 
taught by* `Julia Damerow <http://devo-evo.lab.asu.edu/?q=damerow>`_ *and* `Erick Peirson
<http://gradinfo.cbs.asu.edu/?page_id=49>`_.

Many bibliographic datasets include institutional affiliations for authors. Using 
geocoding services, such as the `Google Geocoding API 
<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/>`_, we can convert 
institution names and addresses into geographic coordinates that can be plotted on a map.
Tethne provides geocoding services in the :mod:`.services.geocode` module.

In this tutorial, we will use the Google Geocoding service to obtain geographic 
coordinates for authors in a coauthorship network (see :ref:`coauthorship`\) and its
derivative, the institutions network (see :func:`.networks.authors.institutions`\). We
will then plot those geo-coded networks in Gephi using the Geo Layout plugin, and overlay
them on a 3D map of the globe in Google Earth.

The examples in this tutorial were generated using records for the journal *Ecology* from
2001-2013. See :ref:`gettingdata`.

Requirements
------------

The Python package `geopy <https://code.google.com/p/geopy/>`_ must be installed and in 
your Python path. You should be able to install it using:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pip install geopy

Are your data suitable?
-----------------------

Not all bibliographic data is amenable to geocoding. When parsing data from the Web of 
Science, Tethne looks for author institutional affiliations in the ``C1`` field. For 
example: ::

   C1 [Keung, Jacky] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.
      [Kocaguneli, Ekrem; Menzies, Tim] W Virginia Univ, Lane Dept Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.

Visually inspect your Web of Science data before proceeding. If most of your data lack the
C1 field, then attempting to geocode a coauthorship network based on these data won't
be particularly fruitful. Try downloading a dataset that contains more recently-published
records.

Since the Web of Science does not use controlled sub-fields for institution addresses,
Tethne pays attention only to the first and last parts of each affiliation field. From
Tethne's perspective, then, the mapping between authors and institutions shown above 
becomes:

=============   =========================================
Author          Institution
=============   =========================================
KEUNG J         HONG KONG POLYTECH UNIV, PEOPLES R CHINA
KOCAGUNELI E    W VIRGINIA UNIV, WV 26505 USA
MENZIES T       W VIRGINIA UNIV, WV 26505 USA   
=============   =========================================
   
When attempting to retrieve geographic information for these institutions, Tethne first 
attempts to retrieve a location for the institution itself, e.g. by passing ``HONG KONG 
POLYTECH UNIV, PEOPLES R CHINA`` to the geocoding service. If this does not yield a 
result, Tethne tries passing the last field only, e.g. ``PEOPLES R CHINA``. Note that for 
most U.S. addresses, the state and zip code are included in the last field, e.g. ``WV 
26505 USA``. The method that successfully yielded a geographic result determines the 
``precision`` field, discussed below.

Coauthorship network with geocoding
-----------------------------------

The :func:`.networks.authors.coauthors` method accepts a boolean keyword argument called
``geocode``. If ``geocode`` is ``True``, Tethne will attempt to generate geographic
coordinates for each node in the coauthorship network based on each authors'
institutional affiliation.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`coauthorship` to generate a coauthorship network. For the
purpose of this tutorial, we will **not** generate a sliced/dynamic network. 

Include the keyword argument ``geocode=True`` when calling 
:func:`.networks.authors.coauthors`\. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from tethne.networks import authors
   >>> coauthors = authors.coauthors(papers, threshold=2, geocode=True)

Export to GraphML
-----------------

In order to visualize our geographic network in `Gephi <http://www.gephi.org>`_, we will
export it to GraphML. See the section :ref:`coauthors_to_graphml` in the
:ref:`coauthorship` tutorial.

If everything went as planned, your GraphML nodes should contain three additional
attributes: ``latitude``, ``longitude``, and ``precision``. By default,
:func:`.networks.authors.coauthors` also includes the ``institution`` attribute. For 
example: ::

   <node id="STEINGER T">
        <data key="latitude">52.132633</data>
        <data key="institution">UNIV WAGENINGEN &amp; RES CTR, NETHERLANDS</data>
        <data key="longitude">5.291266</data>
        <data key="precision">country</data>
   </node>

===========     ==========================================================================
Attribute       Description
===========     ==========================================================================
latitude        Latitude on the Earth, in +/- degrees from the equator.
longitude       Longitude on the Earth, in +/- degrees from the Prime Meridian.
institution     The  author's institutional affiliation.
precision       The search pattern that yielded geographic data. If the geocoding service
                recognized the full institution address, then this will be 
                ``institution``. If only the last field was recognized, then this will be
                ``country``.
===========     ==========================================================================

You may wish to remove nodes that do not contain geographic locations. 

    1. Click the label of the ``precision`` column to sort by precision; this should bring 
       nodes without locations to the top of the list.
    2. Select the nodes that do not have data in the location fields.
    3. Right-click, and click ``Delete all``.

Geo Layout in Gephi
-------------------

Import your GraphML file as described in the section :ref:`coauthors_gephi` in the
:ref:`coauthorship` tutorial.

In the ``Data Laboratory`` tab, you should see columns for the four attributes described
above.

.. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo1.png
   :width: 700
   :align: center

Make sure that both the `GeoLayout <https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/geolayout/>`_
and `ExportToEarth <https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/exporttoearth/>`_ plugins are 
installed.

    1. In the File menu, go to ``Tools > Plugins``. A new window called ``Plugins`` should
       appear.
    2. Click on the ``Installed`` tab, and scroll through the list to find ``GeoLayout``
       and ``ExportToEarth``.
    3. If those plugins are **not** installed, click the ``Available Plugins`` tab, select
       them from the list, and click the ``Install`` button.
    4. Make sure that both plugs are active. In the ``Installed`` tab, select each plugin.
       If they are active, then the ``Activate`` button should be grayed out. If so, do
       nothing. If not, click ``Activate``.
    5. Click the ``Close`` button to return to the main Gephi interface.

.. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo2.png
   :width: 700
   :align: center

Now you're ready to run the GeoLayout. 

    * In the Layout area, select ``Geo Layout`` from the drop-down menu. 
    * Gephi should automatically detect and use the ``latitude`` and ``longitude``
      attributes for your nodes. 
    * The default projection is ``Mercator``; you can change this to suit your needs.
    * Click the ``Run`` button.

If your data are similar to the ones used in this tutorial, you should see something like
the visualization shown in the figure above. The arrangement of the nodes is suggestive of
some familiar national boundaries, especially the United States and western Europe.

In this example, we've also partitioned and colored nodes by institution. This will matter
more when we plot this network in Google Earth, below.

Eigenvector Centrality
----------------------

In this tutorial, we'll introduce another measure of centrality popular in social network
analysis.

**Eigenvector Centrality** is a measure of how well-connected a node is in a network. 
A node has high Eigenvector Centrality if it is connected to other highly-connected nodes.
Google's PageRank algorithm uses something like Eigenvector Centrality to find the most
authoritative or important results for your search query: if a page receives in-links from
other highly-authoritative webpages, it will appear higher in your search results. Unlike
Degree Centrality, Eigenvector Centrality depends not merely on **how many** neighbors
a node has, but also on **how well-connected** those neighbors are. 

In social network analysis, a node with high Eigenvector Centrality might be a 
high-profile leader or public figure. In contrast to nodes with high Betweenness
Centrality, however, nodes with high Eigenvector Centrality may not be strong "brokers";
they may not occupy structurally import positions in the network. For more details, see
`this blog post 
<http://www.activatenetworks.net/blog/who-is-central-to-a-social-network-it-depends-on-your-centrality-measure/>`_.

We'll use Eigenvector Centrality to set the size of the nodes in our coauthorship network.

    1. Go to the ``Overview`` tab.
    2. In the ``Statistics`` window, find ``Eigenvector Centrality`` under ``Node 
       Overview.``
    3. Click ``Run``.

In the ``Data Laboratory`` tab, you should see a new column called ``Eigenvector 
Centrality``.

To map node size to Eigenvector Centrality:

    1. On the left-hand side of the Gephi workspace, find the ``Ranking`` window.
    2. Select ``Eigenvector Centrality`` from the drop-down menu.
    3. Click the red gem icon in the upper right.
    4. Specify a size range to define a linear function for node size vs centrality. You
       can define more complex functions by click on ``Spline...`` in the lower left of
       the Ranking window.
    5. Click the ``Apply`` button, and return to ``Preview``.

   :align: center
    
Zooming in on the United States, we can see that there are a few highly central 
individuals in the east and south, and one in Colorado. Note also that edge widths
vary in size: Gephi automatically detected the ``weight`` attribute on edges between
authors, which indicates how many papers a pair of authors published together.

Plotting geodata on a basemap
-----------------------------

Unfortunately, Gephi does not provide any straightforward way to overlay networks on a
map of the earth. One approach, which we will not address here, is to export your network
view as a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file, and then overlay that image on a basemap
in a graphics editor (e.g. Photoshop or Gimp).

Another approach is to visualize your network in `Google Earth 
<http://www.google.com/earth/>`_. Google Earth reads a special kind of XML file called a
`Keyhole Markup Language (KML) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language>`_
files. The ``ExportToEarth`` plugin in Gephi allows you to save your geocoded network to a
compressed KML, or KMZ, file.

Node size attribute
```````````````````

Before we export our network, we need to make one adjustment to our node attributes so
that we can take our Eigenvector Centrality data along with us into Google Earth. When
Gephi exports your network to KML, it looks for a ``size`` attribute on your nodes, which
it uses to define a node size attribute in KML. Thus we need to copy our Centrality data 
into a ``size`` attribute before exporting to KML.

    1. Go to the ``Data Laboratory``.
    2. Create a new column by clicking on the ``Add column`` button in the lower left.
    3. Name the column ``size``, and select ``Float`` from the ``Type`` drop-down menu.
       Then click ``OK``.

       .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo6.png
          :width: 300
          :align: center
          
    3. Click ``Copy data to other column`` and select ``Eigenvector Centrality``.
    
       .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo7.png
          :width: 400
          :align: center
    
    4. Select ``size`` from the drop-down menu, and click ``OK``.
    
       .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo8.png
          :width: 200
          :align: center
    
The ``Eigenvector Centrality`` and ``size`` columns should now contain precisely the same
values.

Exporting KML (KMZ)
```````````````````

To export your network in KML...

    1. Go to ``File > Export > Graph file...``.
    
       .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo10.png
          :width: 400
          :align: center
    
    2. Select ``KMZ File (*.kmz)`` from the ``File Format`` drop-down menu.

       .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo11.png
          :width: 400
          :align: center
    
    3. Give your file a name that you will remember; don't remove the ``.kmz`` extension.
    4. Click ``Options``, and ensure that the checkbox next to ``size`` is checked, along
       with any other attributes that you'd like to take along.

       .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo12.png
          :width: 400
          :align: center       

    5. Click ``Save``.
    
After a few moments, you should receive confirmation that your export is complete.

Visualization in Google Earth
`````````````````````````````

Find your ``.kmz`` file in your computer's filesystem. If Google Earth is installed 
properly, you should be able to simply double-click the file to open it. If that doesn't
work, start Google Earth, go to ``File > Open``, and select your ``.kmz`` file.

If all goes well, you should see a bunch of nodes and lines criss-crossing a 3D image of
the globe. For help navigating in Google Earth, see `these tutorials 
<http://www.google.com/earth/learn/>`_. 

If you zoom in on a particular region of the globe, you should notice a few things:

    * Nodes come in different sizes, reflecting their Eigenvector Centrality as calculated
      in Gephi. Edges are also different sizes, reflecting their weight.

    .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo13.png
       :width: 700
       :align: center
         
    * Clicking on a node or edge reveals details about that element; e.g. the institution
      with which an author is affiliated.

    .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo14.png
       :width: 400
       :align: center
      
    * In many cases, nodes will overlap. Clicking on a cluster of overlapping nodes will
      cause them to spread out, allowing you to select an individual node. Since node
      colors reflect the institutional partitioning that we did in Gephi, we can quickly
      see whether multiple institutions are represented at a particular locale.
    
    .. image:: _static/images/geographic/geo15.png
       :width: 700
       :align: center

    * Some nodes may not appear to be connected to any other nodes in the network. Since
      only individuals who coauthored papers with other researchers are included in the
      coauthorship network, those orphan nodes should represent cases in which an
      individual published only with other researchers at the same institution. Indeed,
      clicking on such a node should reveal at least two overlapping nodes at that
      location.

Institutional Networks
======================

Summary
-------

In :ref:`coauthorship` we used Gephi's partition tool to collapse our coauthorship network
into an institutional network, in which the connections between institutional nodes
represented coauthorship between individuals affiliated with those respective
institutions. Unfortunately, the institutional nodes created by the partition procedure
do not inherit the geographic attributes associated with the individuals in the original
coauthorship network. 

To deal with situations like this, Tethne has a network-building
method called :func:`.networks.authors.institutions` that produces geocoded institutional
coauthorship networks. The ``size`` attribute on each node indicates the number of authors
in the dataset associated with that institution, and the ``weight`` attribute on each
edge indicates the total number of publications coauthored by individuals at a given pair
of institutions.

Building an institutional network is almost precisely the same as building a coauthorship
network (as above), with the following exceptions:

Use :func:`.networks.authors.institutions` instead of 
:func:`.networks.authors.coauthors`\. The call-signature is almost precisely the same. For
example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> inst = authors.institutions(recent, threshold=2, geocode=True)

Visualization
-------------

Follow the same steps as those described above for visualizing your institutional network.
This time you won't need to create a ``size`` attribute (unless you wish to override it),
as one is already set based on the number of authors affiliated with each institution.

When visualizing the institution network in Google Earth, clicking on a node reveals a
list of all of the authors associated with that institution.
