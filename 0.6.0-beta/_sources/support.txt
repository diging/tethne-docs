Support & Bug Reporting
=======================

The easiest way to get support is via our GitHub `issues page 
<https://github.com/diging/tethne/issues?state=open>`_. Be sure to include as much detail
as possible. Feel free to suggest new features, or harangue us for sloppy bugs.

If that fails, go after `Erick <http://gradinfo.cbs.asu.edu/?page_id=49>`_.
