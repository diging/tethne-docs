    10.1002 Wiley and related publishing houses (e.g. VCH). Wiley has its own DOI format, so does VCH. For papers from the last few years, the online abstract page of the paper generally has the DOI; if not, browse one level up to the table of contents of the journal issue. Example for a Wiley journal paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.1087. Example for a VCH paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1521-3765(20000901)6:17<3287::AID-CHEM3287>3.0.CO;2-J.
    10.1006 Academic Press (IDEAL). The structure of an IDEAL DOI is as follows: 10.1006/jour.year.msnumber, where "jour" is a 4-character journal identifier, "year" is the 4-digit Gregorian calendar year, and "msnumber" the manuscript ID. Example: http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jmsp.1993.1161 UPDATE: all Academic Press journals have been absorbed by Elsevier. While the 10.1006 DOIs shoudl keep working, future papers in these journals will presumably have 10.1016 DOIs.
    10.1007 Springer Verlag. ["Verlag"=German for 'Publishing House'.] Based on PIIs like Elsevier's. Example: http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002140050256.
    10.1016 Elsevier Science. The general format for an Elsevier DOI URL is http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ARTICLE-PII, where ARTICLE-PII stands for the article's Published Item Identifier. The PII can be found on the online abstract page, or on the first page of the fulltext paper (hardcopy or PDF). It has the form Sxxxx-xxxx(yy)zzzzz-c, where xxxx-xxxx is the 8-digit ISSN (International Systematic Serial Number) of the journal, yy are the last two digits of the year, zzzzz is an article number within that year of the journal, and c is a checksum digit. Example: for the article with PII number S1386-1425(00)00450-9, the DOI URL becomes http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1386-1425(00)00450-9. (Note that Elsevier articles are generally "served up" from an external provider called sciencedirect.com.)
    10.1017 Cambridge University Press.
    10.1021 American Chemical Society (ACS). Every ACS article is uniquely defined by a 9-character article identifier (e.g. ja016126t), where the first two characters are the journal abbreviation, the next six digits the paper number within the journal (assigned by the journal editors upon receipt of the submitted paper), and a 1-character checksum. The complete DOI URL is then simply http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ARTICLE-IDENTIFIER, e.g. http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja016126t. Note: DOIs for ASAP (online pre-publication) and the final published article are identical, so a DOI link in your online list of publications can be made as soon as the paper hits the ACS ASAP site, and does not need to be updated afterwards.
    10.1038 NATURE and daughter journals. Final part of DOI is 3-letter code of journal followed by sequantial article number. Example: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nsb889.
    10.1039 Royal Society of Chemistry (RSoC). [Updated: kudos to Richard Kidd, RSoC editorial production] Papers published after 1997 have unique 8-character identifiers, e.g. a904129j. The DOI URL then becomes simply http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/ARTICLE-IDENTIFIER, e.g., http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/a904129j. Papers from the digitized RSoC archive have 12-character IDs of the form jjyyyvvtpppp, where jj is a journal code (P1 = Perkin Transactions 1, F2 = Faraday Transactions 2, well you get the idea), yyy are the last three digits of the year, vv is the volume, t is a type code (F=front matter, B=back matter, 0=paginated, i.e., all articles and some other material), and pppp is a 4-digit page number left-padded with zeroes as necessary. Example: http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/F29888401263 points to J. Chem. Soc. Faraday 2, 84, 1263 (1988).
    10.1046 Blackwell Publishers. Details to follow.
    10.1055 G. Thieme Verlag (Synthesis).Structure: s-YEAR-XXXXX, where XXXXX is a 5-digit article code.
    10.1063 American Institute of Physics. The DOI of recent articles (example: http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1385363) can be found on the online abstract of the paper. However, AIP offers a very convenient alternative (a kind-of "OpenURL avant-la-lettre"): http://link.aip.org/link/?jou/vol/firstpage, where "jou" is the three-letter journal abbreviation (e.g. jcp for Journal of Chemical Physics), "vol" is the volume number and "firstpage" the first page number. Example: http://link.aip.org/link/?jcp/115/2051 will link to J. Chem. Phys. 115, 2051 (2001).
    10.1073 PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [USA]). pnas.XXXXXXXXX, where XXXXXXXXX is a 9-digit manuscript number.
    10.1074 Journal of Biological Chemistry. Structure: jbc.MXXXXXXXXX, where XXXXXXXXX is a 9-digit manuscript number.
    10.1080 Taylor and Francis. This publisher uses 15-character PIIs like Elsevier; again, the PII can generally be found on the online abstract of the journal paper or on the first page of the printed paper. An example DOI URL is http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/002689799163172
    10.1083 Rockefeller University Press (e.g. Journal of Cell Biology)
    10.1092 Laser Pages Publishing (=Israel Journal of [fill in subject]). Structure: e.g. V0Q8-T3XM-N68W-D8NL.
    10.1093 Oxford University Press, EMBO (European Molecular Biology Organisation). Structure: emboj/aaaXXX, where emboj stands for EMBO Journal and aaaXXX is a 3-letter, 3-digit article code.
    10.1103 American Physical Society. Example: http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.68.021801. As you see, JournalName.Volume.ArticleNumber. Like for AIP, an alternative URL is given as follows: http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v68/e021801.
    10.1107 International Union of Crystallography (e.g. Acta Crystallographica series). Uses PIIs in same way as Elsevier (see above).
    10.1126 SCIENCE magazine. Structure: science.XXXXXXX, where XXXXXXX is a 7-digit article code.
    10.1161 American Heart Association.
    10.1182 American Society of hematology (e.g. the journal Blood).
