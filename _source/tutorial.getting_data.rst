Getting Bibliographic Data
==========================

As of v0.8, Tethne can parse data from the ISI Web of Science, JSTOR's
Data-for-Research portal, Zotero (RDF), and Scopus (limited support).

Web of Science
--------------

The ISI Web of Science is a proprietary database owned by Thompson Reuters.
If you are affiliated with an academic institution, you may have access to
this database via an institutional license.

To access the Web of Science database via the Arizona State University library,
find the Web of Science entry_ in the library's online catalog. You may be
prompted to log in to the University's Central Authentication System.

Perform a search for literature of interest using the interface provided.

Your search criteria will be informed by the objectives of your research
project. If you are attempting to characterize the development of a research
field, for example, you should choose terms that pick out that field as uniquely
as possible (consider using the ``Publication Name`` search field). You can also
pick out literatures originating from particular institutions, by using the
``Organization-Enhanced`` search field.

Note also that you can restrict your research to one of three indexes in the Web
of Science Core Collection:

   * Science Citation Index Expanded is the largest index, containing scientific
     publications from 1900 onward.
   * Social Sciences Citation Index covers 1956 onward.
   * Arts & Humanities Citation Index is the smallest index, containing
     publications from 1975 onward.

Once you have found the papers that you are interested in, find the ``Send to:``
menu at the top of the list of results. Click the small orange down-arrow, and
select ``Other File Formats``.

.. image:: _static/images/tutorial/getting.2.png
   :width: 60%

A small in-browser window should open in the foreground. Specify the range of
records that you wish to download. **Note that you can only download 500 records
at a time**, so you may have to make multiple download requests. Be sure to
specify ``Full Record and Cited References`` in the *Record Content* field, and
``Plain Text`` in the *File Format* field. Then click ``Send``.

After a few moments, a download should begin. WoS usually returns a field-tagged
data file called ``savedrecs.txt``. Put this in a location on your filesystem
where you can find it later; this is the input for Tethne's WoS reader methods.

Structure of the WoS Field-Tagged Data File
```````````````````````````````````````````

If you open the text file returned by the WoS database (usually named
'savedrecs.txt'), you should see a whole bunch of field-tagged data.
"Field-tagged" means that each metadata field is denoted by a "tag" (a
two-letter code), followed by values for that field. A complete list of WoS
field tags can be found here_. For best results, you should avoid making changes
to the contents of WoS data files.

.. _here: http://images.webofknowledge.com/WOKRS53B4/help/WOS/hs_wos_fieldtags.html

The metadata record for each paper in your data file should begin with:

.. code-block:: none

   PT J

...and end with:

.. code-block:: none:

   ER

There are two author fields: the AU field is always provided, and values take
the form "Last, FI". AF is provided if author full-names are available, and
values take the form "Last, First Middle". For example:

.. code-block:: none

   AU Dauvin, JC
      Grimes, S
      Bakalem, A
   AF Dauvin, Jean-Claude
      Grimes, Samir
      Bakalem, Ali

Citations are listed in the CR block. For example:

.. code-block:: none:

   CR Airoldi L, 2007, OCEANOGR MAR BIOL, V45, P345
      Alexander Vera, 2011, Marine Biodiversity, V41, P545, DOI 10.1007/s12526-011-0084-1
      Arvanitidis C, 2002, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V244, P139, DOI 10.3354/meps244139
      Bakalem A, 2009, ECOL INDIC, V9, P395, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolind.2008.05.008
      Bakalem Ali, 1995, Mesogee, V54, P49
      â€¦
      Zenetos A, 2005, MEDITERR MAR SCI, V6, P63
      Zenetos A, 2004, CIESM ATLAS EXOTIC S, V3

More recent records also include the institutional affiliations of authors in the C1
block.

.. code-block:: none:

   C1 [Wang, Changlin; Washida, Haruhiko; Crofts, Andrew J.; Hamada, Shigeki;
   Katsube-Tanaka, Tomoyuki; Kim, Dongwook; Choi, Sang-Bong; Modi, Mahendra; Singh,
   Salvinder; Okita, Thomas W.] Washington State Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Pullman, WA 99164
   USA.

JSTOR Data-for-Research
-----------------------

The `JSTOR Data-for-Research (DfR) portal
<http://dfr.jstor.org/?&helpview=about_dfr>`_ gives researchers access to
bibliographic data and N-grams for the entire JSTOR database.

Tethne can use DfR data to generate coauthorship networks, and to improve
metadata for Web of Science records. Increasingly, Tethne is also able to use
N-gram counts to add information to networks, and can generate corpora for some
common topic modeling tools.

Access the DfR portal at
`http://dfr.jstor.org/ <http://dfr.jstor.org/>`_ If you don't already have an
account, you will need to `create a new account
<http://dfr.jstor.org/accounts/register/>`_.

After you've logged in, perform a search using whatever criteria you please.
When you have achieved the result that you desire, create a new dataset request.
Under the "Dataset Request" menu in the upper-right corner of the page, click
"Submit new request".

.. image:: _static/images/tutorial/getting.5.png
   :width: 60%

On the **Download Options** page, select your desired **Data Type**. If you do
not intend to make use of the contents of the papers themselves, then "Citations
Only" is sufficient. Otherwise, choose word counts, bigrams, etc.

**Output Format** should be set to **XML**.

Give your request a title, and set the maximum number of articles. *Note that
the maximum documents allowed per request is 1,000. Setting **Maximum Articles**
to a value less than the number of search results will yield a random sample of
your results.*

.. image:: _static/images/tutorial/getting.6.png
   :width: 60%

Your request should now appear in your list of **Data Requests**. When your
request is ready (hours to days later), you will receive an e-mail with a
download link. When downloading from the **Data Requests** list, be sure to use
the link in the **full dataset** column.

.. image:: _static/images/tutorial/getting.7.png
   :width: 60%

When your dataset download is complete, unzip it. The contents should look
something like those shown below.

.. image:: _static/images/tutorial/getting.8.png
   :width: 40%

``citations.XML`` contains bibliographic data in XML format. The ``bigrams``,
``trigrams``, ``wordcounts`` folders contain N-gram counts for each document.

In the example above, the path this dataset is
`/Users/erickpeirson/Downloads/DfR/ecology_1960-64`. This is the path used in
:func:`tethne.readers.dfr.read` .

JSTOR Full-Text Data
````````````````````

JSTOR occasionally provides full-text data to researchers, upon request. These
data are usually provided in a format similar to the one used for N-grams
(e.g. with a ``citations.xml`` metadata file). The text for each document is
stored as a single XML file, the name of which is based on the document's DOI.

The structure of each document looks something like this:

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <article id="10.2307/4330485">
    <page> <![CDATA[The text for the first page]]> </page>
    <page> <![CDATA[The text for the second page]]> </page>
    <page> <![CDATA[The text for the third page]]> </page>
   </article>


Such a dataset can be parsed just like any DfR dataset, and the document
structure (pagination and word order) will be preserved. See ...

Scopus
------

As of v0.6.0-beta, Tethne provides limited support for data from the `Scopus
<http://www.elsevier.com/online-tools/scopus>`_ bibliographic database. Tethne
has undergone relatively less testing with Scopus datasets, so it is probable
that errors will arise. Please help make Tethne better by submitting bug
reports!

Perform your search without whatever parameters you prefer. In this example, we
are searching for documents with ``phenotypic`` or ``plasticity`` in their
titles, abstracts, or keywords, and we're searching all available data in
Scopus.

From the search results page, select the records that you wish to export using
the checkboxes at left. Then click on "Export", just above the search results.
This should open a menu that looks similar to the one shown below.

Be sure to select the following:

**File type**: CSV
**Information to export**: All available information

Then click the "Export" button in the bottom right.

.. image:: _static/images/tutorial/getting.10.png
   :width: 60%

After a few moments, your browser should begin downloading a file called
``scopus.csv``. If you were to open that file in your favorite spreadsheet
application, the contents should look something like what is shown below.

Zotero
------

`Zotero <https://www.zotero.org/>`_ is a tool for collecting and managing
bibliographic data. Zotero is especially useful as a data collection tool for
computational humanities, since it is quite good at scraping metadata and (when
available) full-text documents from databases like Google Scholar, JSTOR, and
PubMed.

For an introduction to Zotero, see the `Quick Start Guide
<https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide>`_.

For an introduction to collecting bibliographic metadata and full-text
content with Zotero, see `this video tutorial <https://vimeo.com/84316405>`_.
For a text version, see `this tutorial
<https://github.com/erickpeirson/methods/blob/master/1-collecting-data-with-zotero.md>`_.

In order to work with your Zotero collection in Tethne, you will first need to
export it in Zotero
`RDF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework>`_ format.

.. Note: This format isn't strictly valid RDF (puzzlingly), but the necessary
         corrections are made internally to parse it.

To export a collection:

1. Select the collection from your Library.
2. Right-click on the collection, and select "Export Collection". A small modal
   dialog should appear.
3. Select "Zotero RDF" from the Format field.
4. If you want to parse full-text content (e.g. from attached PDF files), check
   the "Export Files" option.
5. Click OK. An Export (save) dialog should appear.
6. Navigate to the place on your filesystem to which you wish to export your
   collection. Put it someplace easy to find, since you'll need to know the path
   to your export later on.
7. Give your export a name in the "Save As" field.
8. Click OK.

This will create a new directory with the name that you specified in step ``7``.
Inside, you should find a file with the same name, and a ``.rdf`` extension. If
you opted to include attached files (step ``4``), you should also see a folder
called "files".
